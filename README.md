# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

Starting coding is intimidating, so I wanted to tackle it head on and report to the world my experience and what I learned for this prework guide.
Going in knowing nothing, I learned how to set up HTML, CSS, and Javascript using Git and GitHub.

Use this if you are a boot camp student going through the Pre-work. It contains brief notes on everything I have learned thus far.
